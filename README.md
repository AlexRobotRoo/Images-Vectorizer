# Images-Vectorizer
Program vectorizes an input raster image and creates output .svg file. The general technique used is known as quadtree subdivision and it lends itself well to recursive implementation. 
This project is an adaptation of [work] (http://asserttrue.blogspot.com/2010/01/fast-conversion-of-bitmaps-to-svg.html) in the C# language.
